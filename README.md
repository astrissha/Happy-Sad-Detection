# Happy-Sad-Detection
This project uses a neural network to detect emotions—happy or sad—from facial expressions in images. A CNN model is trained on labeled images and deployed using a Streamlit web app, where users can upload a test image for real-time emotion prediction. It helps in understanding affective states through AI.
